# Problem

Car rental companies currently find it difficult to refer drivers to fines
quickly and scalably. This denotes astronomical loss of money.

## What is?

This feature can be used when the vehicle was being driven by someone other
than the owner at the time of the assessment. In this case, the vehicle
owner can subsequently inform the driver's data.

Important! For vehicles owned by legal entities, it is mandatory to make
the identification of the offending driver, otherwise, if driver does not do it
correctly, the driver will incur fines under the
[terms of article 257, paragraph 8, of the Brazilian Traffic Code][1], called
**NIC** (Fine of Non-Identification Driver).

## Maximum time limit for nomination

According to [CTB][2], if, after the period of **15 days**, the offender is not
identified, and the owner of the vehicle is a legal entity, a new fine will
be imposed on the owner of the vehicle.

This new fine originated by the infraction will have the value multiplied
by the number of times that the same infraction is committed within the
period of 12 months.

Therefore, according to the law, when the company does not indicate the
driver, the transit authority that sent the notification must penalize
the owner.

## Calculate NIC

The NIC fine should be calculated by multiplying the amount predicted
for the original fine by the number of equal infractions committed in a
12-month period.

As an example, we can take the case of a driver from your company who
received a serious fine, in the amount of R$195.23, when driving with one
of the company's vehicles.

If you, the manager, do not perform driver identification within 15 days,
the traffic authority will penalize the company with the NIC fine, requiring
the payment of R$390.46.

## How to indicate

Depending on where the vehicle driver was assessed, the following
possibilities exist:

- Internet
- Mail
- Telephone
